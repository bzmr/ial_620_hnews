Jim is becoming part of IBM uper management and keeps leading the Red Hat business unit. If Gini starts some crazy moves to endanger Red Hat&#x27;s well being as an entity inside IBM (as in IBM-fying the company), she will get at odds with Jim and RH upper management. So she can fire them all and pay up bilions in golden parachutes, at which point they will probably found a Green Hat company and hire away all Red Hat employees... or Gini can keep her word in the deal and leave Red Hat a separate business unit within IBM, one that grows revenues and profits, unlike most IBM business units. And IBM is a meritocracy, if Red Hat continues good performance, expect Red Hat execs taking top position, including next CEO role.

That requires knowledge on both sides of the house.<p>The world is going to open-source distributed systems built on commodity hardware, which Red Hat has done a great job of building a business model around. For old established companies, though, the migration is a lot of work, and there are _definitely_ still plenty of large companies who have purchased&#x2F;leased mainframes for long periods of time, and would like to modernize, but also can&#x27;t afford to throw everything away and rebuild from scratch. There&#x27;s a lot of work being done already between the two companies to run Go, Docker, Kubernetes, etc, on mainframe, and for companies with mainframe resources, being able to get a little more utility out of those sunk costs is very attractive, and something Red Hat&#x27;s expertise has (and would continue to, presumably) help accomplish.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m pretty surprised at the news, and I&#x27;ll be watching closely to see how things go.",

              "text": "For a large public corporation usually a clear majority of shares are held as pure investment by big institutional investors like pension companies. Their goal is to turn a small amount of money into a large amount of money without too much risk. So they have no reason to block this sort of deal.<p>Moreover, such companies are often desperate to minimise overheads on operations. Once upon a time they&#x27;d employ dozens of specialists, now they&#x27;re relying on computer models as much as possible to reduce costs and don&#x27;t much care about what&#x27;s actually driving the price changes that the model is looking at.<p>Boards at big companies actually now know this. Suppose you&#x27;re the board of a big corp and you&#x27;d like $10M each even though you didn&#x27;t do a good job? Just write up paperwork saying you propose that you get paid $10M extra each because of diddly-dee, put it up for a vote by shareholders with a recommendation that they vote &quot;Yes&quot;. A few smaller shareholders are paying attention, they&#x27;ll vote &quot;No&quot;. The big institutions are entirely on auto-pilot, and will follow your &quot;Yes&quot; recommendation, your vote passes, you now get $10M with no effort. Giving the board a pile of money for no reason might bankrupt the company. Not your problem, the shareholders voted for it.<p>For the pension company making your shareholders $10 and then asking for $1 to cover overheads from actual specialists (10%) is seen as worse than making your shareholders $8 and then asking for 10¢ to cover overheads from a few pencil pushers (1.25%) even though in the first scenario the shareholder kept $9 and in the second they only got $7.90. Nobody wants to pay 10%. The result was foreseeable but it&#x27;s hard to say if it could have been prevented.<p>The Red Hat board will recommend shareholders accept the offer. Big institutions will (and in this case in my opinion quite rightly) automatically agree and so it doesn&#x27;t matter what a handful of small private shareholders do.",

For example I personally am very much connected to JS people and Linux&#x2F;Open Source people. I rarely meet any ASP or Java based stacks.<p>I think it also depends on who you are developing for. Governments and enterprises for sure use more Microsoft or Java based solutions while startups and private companies are more &quot;bleeding edge&quot;.<p>So to answer your question, I think you&#x27;re right.

Maybe outside of Denmark, but our little department is actually one of the few places which uses Node for serious backend application in the entire country. At least that I know of.<p>I mean, I can go on job databases or LinkedIn right now, and there isn’t a single full stack JS job available in my entire country. There is a lot of JS including jobs of course but they all require you to also&#x2F;mainly do C#, JAVA, PHP or Python because JS is almost exclusive used on the frontend.<p>Don’t get me wrong, I actually really like the JS environment. There’s a reason we moved to it, but it’s not like it doesn’t have its flaws either.<p>I think WASM will absolutely change web development, but I think it’s already made it to the <i>is</i>, I mean, we’re launching our first minor Blazor app this week, and it’s something we typically would’ve build with vue and graphql Apollo, but now it’s all C#.<p>The world of enterprise typically moves slow though. We’ve recently bought an on boarding system that’s made with web forms for instance. You may laugh at that, but the truth is, at least in my part of the world, that JS hasn’t seen that much adoption outside of hobbyists. Eventually these companies are going to upgrade their client sides, but would you pick modern JS or full stack C# if you were coming from web forms? Hell even if they go vue, react or angular chances are they’ll still use .Net on the backend, as that seems to be the trend pretty much everywhere except for us.",

Plus of course there&#x27;s z&#x2F;OS, which I know enough about to respect (and want to play with someday :) ).<p>Talos basically offers only Linux and a mildly DIY standing-up experience (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tenfourfox.blogspot.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;a-semi-review-of-raptor-talos-ii.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tenfourfox.blogspot.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;a-semi-review-of-rap...</a>), although this is likely to be reasonably painless for non-desktop configurations (and perhaps volume orders can come preconfigured).<p>As a bit of a pet idea I kind of want to colocate one of the 2U or 4U systems for generic web serving and similar duties, but I fear that running a blog&#x2F;discussion system on such a machine may result in a constant effort (on my part) at keeping discussion focused on the &quot;it&#x27;s a different architecture, what comp-sci interesting things can we do with it&quot; aspect instead of getting distracted by shallow OCD-meta-security bikeshedding.<p>(It&#x27;s kind of sad that the collective consensus about new&#x2F;different architectures has to always be about security nowadays, and not about unbiased exploration, which is what we&#x27;re best at)",

Most places I&#x27;ve been don&#x27;t even look at testing a major version of a new OS for at least year.  There are just too many variables between hardware, drivers, and software and little to no benefit in staying bleeding edge.<p>Let&#x27;s say there was a new feature.  It might be an improvement in almost every regard, but how it behaves at the limits or when left unattended might not play well with every other piece in the system.  Part of it might be changing user&#x2F;business expectations, or changing the pieces around, but that can literally take years.<p>A few wrinkles I&#x27;ve heard about, but haven&#x27;t directly dealt with is that RHEL7&#x2F;systemd is too polite about unmounting disks on shutdown which means it will just hang.  This is a huge problem for remote workstations that don&#x27;t have IPMI.  Another issue I&#x27;ve heard about is issues with a bunch of our diskless servers don&#x27;t play well with it.  Having to migrate and troubleshoot core issues like these every 2 years is just unfeasible.<p>As you point out, just working at a place where everything is 10 years old is frustrating, too.  Last week I was trying to build VLC, which requires C++11 and had issues.  At previous jobs I pushed really hard for a new enough kernel to evaluate Docker and have spent a lot of time selling people on Git.",

And it&#x27;s mostly for selfish reasons. The overall dev mindshare of RH based systems has shrunk compared to Ubuntu. So anything that moves people away from Ubuntu to the RH ecosystem is net win because eventually some corp will write a check when they need support.

You would think that something would&#x27;ve been done about it.<p>All that said, perhaps I&#x27;m just dumb. I&#x27;ll be happy to see someone prove me wrong and succeed with that combo. The underlying technology is certainly interesting and powerful. But I won&#x27;t be trying it.",

It doesn&#x27;t do anything more than just execute this command.<p>The command is part of the RC system. Typically written in shell, it handles walking &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.*&#x2F; and running the scripts contained therein to configure and invoke the various services for a particular runlevel.<p>You can boot linux using your own init and skip the rc system. From grub, add &quot;init=&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh&quot; to your kernel parameters and you will get a shell as pid=1 and no other processes -- from there you can run commands as you wish to bring your system the rest of the way up. If you were to run &quot;&#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.d&#x2F;rc 3&quot; by hand you would invoke the same scripts that normally run on bootup to runlevel 3.<p>You could also delete all these shell scripts and replace them with your own code for configuring the system.",

I agree there isn&#x27;t widespread understanding of this distinction but I think it is because most engineers simply don&#x27;t know how any of this works.<p>The reason to keep these things modular is flexibility and ease of analysis and improvement. The major criticism I see with systemd is that has undefined operational scope and unbounded feature creep. It has no stable interface between components and changes behavior in incompatible and difficult to predict ways fairly regularly. From a systems perspective it&#x27;s a big ball of mud and the lack of a formal interface makes it prohibitively difficult to change or replace its subsystems.<p>I don&#x27;t like that systemd performs ANSI animations on my machine&#x27;s serial console, for example. Have you seen the &quot;marquee&quot; animations it does when certain services start? I sure would like to force it to print sequential lines of text instead, but I can&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t like that when systemd updated basic utilities like &quot;reboot&quot; I lost the ability to use them in a chroot. Even &quot;reboot -f&quot; which does not need to talk to init. I had to write my own one-liner to call reboot(2) myself not too long ago.<p>System components need to be well scoped and replaceable.

I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s unique to systemd, just that it&#x27;s useful. I expect many next-gen init systems will be implementing many similar features to systemd.<p>&gt; This is just cgroups, a function of the kernel, not systemd<p>And Docker resource control is just cgroups too. Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not much much easier to use. The value of systemd&#x27;s resource control options is that it comes with a constraint solver and sets up the cgroups to satisfy your desires. If you have many services all with their own caps it becomes very annoying to figure out how to set up the ratios of CPU shares.<p>&gt; Automount, existed for 15 years at this point.<p>And it&#x27;s been super flaky for 15 years. Would you rather edit automount maps or just say, &quot;hey when this path is first accessed, mount it.&quot;<p>&gt; Polkit<p>Huh? Polkit 100% cannot do this. This is the ability to set and deny Linux capabilities to services. systemd is actually providing something very unique here which as of yet doesn&#x27;t exist outside systemd.<p>The userspace tools for capabilities allow you to set them on files so that when you exec them they have (or are denied) the capabilities you set. But what about an interpreted program like python or node? You probably don&#x27;t want to set CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE on <i>all</i> node processes, just your web server.<p>Systemd makes this very easy by starting a service as root, dropping capabilies to match your directives then execing the service. Nothing magic but something very few tools let you do. Someone could write a tool for this but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t exist anywhere in my repos.<p>&gt; You know they adopted a boot loader for this right?<p>Look I know it&#x27;s gummyboot. Gummyboot is great. Just because it&#x27;s now systemd-boot doesn&#x27;t make it any less good. In fact it makes it better since the userspace tooling systemd added greatly improved the experience using it.<p>&gt; What does this mean?<p>Downloading updates to apply, rebooting into a minimal environment to apply them, and then rebooting back into your system. It&#x27;s a very slick implementation.<p>&gt; Why forget about things that work?<p>Drastically reduced complexity and attack surface because timesyncd focuses entirely on being a client.<p>&gt; Same as cgroups again.<p>Yes they use cgroups under the hood. Tell me how to, from a shell, run an arbitrary process capped at 30% CPU and 128M of memory that&#x27;s easier than<p>systemd-run -t -p MemoryMax=128M -p CPUQuota=30% my-process<p>&gt; LXC or in a real pinch, cgroups + chroot.<p>Right, but systemd is providing the tooling to make it easy package and run services like this.<p>&gt; Polkit. This is what polkit was designed for.<p>Polkit literally cannot do this. Tell me how to make a user $service exist only while $service is running.",

Patents at IBM are so highly valued that they often act as a blinder towards open source.<p>However, there are definitely groups inside of IBM that choose to open source their work instead of filing for patents. For example, the team that I&#x27;m currently on works on the Carbon Design System [0], which is entirely open source. All the work our team does is out in the open too [1][2], which is great!<p>I would say that for teams like this, the tendency is to open source software and patent processes that are unique to IBM or a particular domain. That way we can try and contribute back as much useful technology as we can!<p>Obviously there are others at the company who might have a different perspective, but thankfully we&#x27;re also trying to spread our own take on alternatives to the traditional processes at IBM.<p>Hope this info can help make your time at IBM a little bit better!<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbondesignsystem.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbondesignsystem.com&#x2F;</a>\n[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;carbon-design-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;carbon-design-system</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IBM?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=carbon&amp;type=&amp;language=\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IBM?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=carbon&amp;type=&amp;languag...</a>",

IBM has hardly had the best history when it comes to treating its acquisitions (or its employees for that matter).<p>On the other hand, I know quite a few folks who work for IBM and do great free software work. I want to think that RedHat would be treated like OzLabs -- a fairly isolated group that gets to continue working on all of the free software work they have always done.<p>Here&#x27;s hoping it works out. The survival of RedHat (or any large free software company) is very important to the longevity of the projects that we all depend on.<p>[I work at SUSE, though I wasn&#x27;t around during the Novell years I have heard plenty of horror stories.

The way I think about it is in a few ways. 1) IBM&#x27;s stock price has been tanking because I think they&#x27;re not investing in new products but just cutting expenditures to meet stupid Wall-Street targets. But with the introduction of RedHat they get new &quot;blood&quot; as it were. Who knows, what if they make the CEO of RedHat the CEO of IBM a la Satya Nadella and Microsoft?<p>They have said that RedHat would remain an independent part of IBM as part of their cloud push. Let&#x27;s take them at their word unless they prove us wrong. Also, if nothing else, this could give RedHat even more money to make ambitious bets -- perhaps we might see Power9 systems running Fedora soon?<p>In the end I think this is, on the whole, a good thing. Now, does MS buy Canonical?",

If true, that seems like it mostly turned out to be extremely naive, since Oracle immediately locked down whatever they thought they could sell and cut off everything else.<p>To be honest the only way Red Hat selling out would&#x27;ve been more disheartening would&#x27;ve been if it was Oracle making the rounds again.

Yes, the money all goes into one pot at the end of the day, but there&#x27;s large variance across organizations within IBM.<p>That said, from what I can tell OSS that goes into the IBM machine doesn&#x27;t usually come out the other side improved. I worry for the health of CentOS&#x2F;RHEL&#x2F;Fedora under IBM&#x27;s leadership. My desktop and server OS of choice, with a few brief forays into other territories along the way, has been from Red Hat for 23 years. I&#x27;d hate to lose Fedora or CentOS, or see them stagnate. Red Hat has been among the most steadfast in their support of Open Source software, as well...so, there&#x27;s a real risk of the kernel, Gnome, and other OSS core infrastructure suffering, because Red Hat is a major contributor to those projects.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be sudden. It usually takes years for projects to become clearly worse for having come under IBM&#x27;s purview. Red Hat is large itself, and will probably take years to be fully assimilated and homogenized into IBM&#x27;s lukewarm culture of mere competence with regard to their Open Source contributions.",

Because of the sheer amount of data, it’s an interesting problem, but you could generally work with the researchers to impose good I&#x2F;O behavior that gets around the POSIX constraints peculiarities of the particular filesystems. You want 100,000,000 cpu hours on a $200M computer? You can do the work to make the filesystem writes easier on the system.<p>Coming into private industry was a real eye-opener. You’re in-house staff and you don’t get to say who can use the computer. People use the filesystems for IPC, store 100M files of 200B each, read() and write() terabytes of data 1B at a time, you name it. If I had $100 for every job in which I saw 10,000 cores running a stat() in a while loop waiting for some data to get written to it by one process that had long since died, I’d be retired on a beach somewhere.<p>The problem with POSIX I&#x2F;O is that it’s so, so easy and it almost always works when you expect it to. GPFS (what I’m most familiar with) is amazing at enforcing the consistency. I’ve seen parallel filesystems and disk break in every imaginable way and in a lot of ways that aren’t, but I’ve never seen GPFS present data inconsistently across time where some write call was finished and it’s data didn’t show up to a read() started after the write got its lock or a situation where some process opened a file after the unlink was acknowledged. For a developer who hasn’t ever worked with parallel computing and whose boss just wants them to make it work, the filesystem is an amazing tool. I honestly can’t blame a developer who makes it work for 1000 cores and then gets upset with me when it blows up at 1500. I get grouchy with them, but I don’t blame them. (There’s a difference!)<p>But as the filesystems get bigger, the amount of work the filesystems have to do to maintain that consistency isn’t scaling. The amount of lock traffic flying back and forth between all the nodes is a lot of complexity to keep up with, and if you have the tiniest issue with your network even on some edge somewhere, you’re going to have a really unpleasant day.<p>One of the things that GCE and AWS have done so well is to just abandon the concept of the shared POSIX filesystem, and produce good tooling to help people deal with the IPC and workflow data processing without it. It’s a hell of a lot of work to go from an on-site HPC environment to GCE though. There’s a ton of money to be made for someone who can make that transition easier and cheaper (if you’ve got it figured out, you know, call me. I want to on it!), but people have sunk so much money into their parallel filesystems and disk that it’s a tough ask for the C-suite. Hypothetically speaking, someone I know really well who’s a lot like me was recently leading a project to do exactly this that got shut down basically because they couldn’t prove it would be cheaper in 3 years.",

If they keep these people working on hard problems, they’ll do well. If they try to replace them with inexpensive staff, it will fall apart in months.<p>Parallel POSIX-compliant filesystems at scale are an astonishingly hard problem, and adding the feature set they have while keeping it relatively stable and performant is really worthy of admiration. Every one of the dozens of conversations I’ve had with their developers and technical leads have left me more impressed. They literally can’t test it internally at the scale that their large customers run it, but they’re really good at finding problems and pushing out hotfixes that work pretty well.<p>That said, if I never have to touch it again for as long as I live, I’ll be a very happy man.

The current CEO is a peacetime CEO: he managed a successful business competently in fair wheather, but is not fit to navigate the rough seas ahead. This allows him to leave on a victory (“the largest software acquisition ever!”) and go on a book tour or something. Meanwhile IBM can delude themselves a few more years until they’ve finished milking Red Hat’s products for easy growth.

Reason being the precise &quot;4 years&quot; that was used. Not 2, not 3, not 5.

I point out that five minutes ago they asked me to sign a contract without consulting a legal expert. Their multi-page contract had been painstakingly drafted by a team of expensive lawyers and meticulously tweaked over years. Yet they gave me mere seconds to read it, understand it, and sign it under duress of not receiving medical attention. If they balk at the contract I hand back to them, how can they expect me not to balk at the original contract?<p>On the other hand, if they refuse to provide medical care because I wouldn&#x27;t sign away my rights to any photographs that might be submitted to medical journals, they had better be very confident in their lawyers.<p>Banks, rental agencies, repair shops, etc., on the other hand, can safely refuse my revised contract.

To make significant profits, we need to sell services on top of our software products (this is essentially GBS and their &quot;strong&quot; sales people)<p>2. To make very good profits, we need to make highly customizable software (for example AI and BI offerings).<p>3. To make even more profit we need to make sure the software is tuned to the hardware we make.<p>If one of those weakens the entire IBM portfolio and profits weaken dramatically.<p>Here&#x27;s problems in last 7 years tho:\n1. People moving to the cloud so the hardware business flatlines.\n2. Because people moved to the cloud they found replacements to IBM software.\n3. At the end of the day IBM is forced to deliver professional services on top of other companies&#x27; software and hardware (and services employees are not cheap).<p>At some point the IBM execs must have had an epiphany that their AI offerings don&#x27;t sell because they don&#x27;t have a platform that sells other commodity cloud services on top of which AI components can be sold as high-priced addons.<p>So thus IBM decided to do what it does best --- take control of the entire stack.<p>With this acquisition IBM has the potential to become a next gen. cloud vendor. For example IBM has been trying to sell Bluemix as a hybrid PaaS&#x2F;IaaS but haven&#x27;t been very successful. The engineering team in Bluemix is weak and one way to really up the ante is getting access to top talent in the industry to do this (CoreOS team, Openshift.io team, linux kernel devs, distributed storage devs).",

RH now being IBM will make people turn to Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu and  Devuan. The press release on redhat.com talks almost exclusively about &quot;the cloud&quot;, but &quot;the cloud&quot; is, and always has been, antithetical to Unix (Unix being about site autonomy and simple tools working together). Why would indie devs and idealists want to contribute their efforts to enslaving people in &quot;the cloud&quot; anyway? &quot;Cloud&quot; stuff is also at odds with user freedom, and only seeks to make software runnable over shitty web frontends for undue profit and privacy invasion, when F&#x2F;OSS software has been out there in abundance for over a decade.
